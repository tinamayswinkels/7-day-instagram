Oh hey there, welcome to day 1.&nbsp;<br><br>We were off to a bit of a rocky start this morning sending you out the coding email by mistake, and now you've managed to be so quick to dive in to the tutorials that you're faster than our internet upload speed is right now.&nbsp;<br><br>So here's a bonus lesson. What do you do when you make a mistake, or something goes wrong that affects your customer experience?&nbsp;<br><br>You take ownership for any mistakes, and then you over deliver to make sure that everyone walks away with an amazing experience.&nbsp;<br><br>So since you managed to make it here before day 1's lesson has loaded we're going to give you a 1 hour workshop on marketing strategy and building out effective sales funnels that's normally reserved for our Bootcamp students.&nbsp;<br><br>It will only be here until the new video has loaded, so isn't that a nice little surprise for you\! Don't have time to watch it right now, but still want to make the most of our little delay? Just click on the video and load it in Youtube directly and save that tab for later.&nbsp;

You're welcome :P&nbsp;
